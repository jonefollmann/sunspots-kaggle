# Predicting Sunspots with Neural Networks

This work in the final practice lab for a course with TensorFlow that use a Kaggle dataset of Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number.

This work is a combination of three types of networks: the data windows will pass through a convolution, followed by stacked LSTMs, followed by stacked dense layers. 

Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle.
